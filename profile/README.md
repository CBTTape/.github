# CBTTAPE

These repositories are mirrors of the files found at https://cbttape.org. All the files have
been `unzip'd` and expanded from `xmit` format so that the files are easier to access.

Each repository is also in a format that makes them easy to clone using `zigi` - the z/OS ISPF Git Interface
that can be found at https://github.com/zigi/zigi

This is work in progress and we are looking for volunteers to assist with:

1. The mirroring operation
   - detecting changes at the cbttape.org site and mirroring those updates
2. Expanding the CBTTape file contents by correctly detecting the content type
3. Documenting how to use these repositories
4. and more that I can't think of right now

To help feel free to reach out to Henri Kuiper at henrikuiper@zdevops.com.
